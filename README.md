# Mice-Protein-Expression
A data mining project. Goal: perform clustering and classification on a mice protein expressions data-set using various algorithms and present and compare results.

## Problem Statement
For a mice, 80 features are measured ( 77 proteins/protein modifications + genotype + behavior + treatment ). Given these features, classify it into one of the 8 classes.

## Algorithms

### Clasification
- Naive Bayes
- Multilayer Perceptron
- K-Nearest Neighbours 

### Clustering
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
